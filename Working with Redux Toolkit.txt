Working with Redux Toolkit

1.	npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
2.	Remove redux from package.jason
3.	Import {createSlice} from @reduxjs/toolkit
4.	Slices of the store can be created using the following syntax:
	Const slice = createSlice({
	name:'',
	initialState: {},
	reducers: {
	smallReducersMethods: (state, action) => {
	},
	}
	})
5.	ConfigureStore combines multiple reducers and can be used as: 
	configureStore({
	reducer: {name: slice.reducer}
	})
6.	Export actions = slice.actions;
7.	Actions can be dispatched like: actions.reducersMethod(payload);
